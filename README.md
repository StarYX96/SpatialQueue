# BirthDeathChain-SpatialQueue

On this site, we provide the codes used to conduct the numerical experiments of the paper entitled "A Birth and Death Chain Solution to a Spatial Queueing Problem". All the cosed are written in Python. To compile and run the codes, one may need to install Python with veirsion larger than 3.9.

---File HomogeneousRate.py is the Python codes that calculates the probability distribution for homogeneoues service rate using both original hypercube model and 
the birth and death chain model;

---File HeterogeneousRate.py is the Python codes that calculates the probability distribution for heterogeneoues service rate using both sparse solver and 
the birth and death chain model;

---File Parallel.py is the Python codes that calculates the probability distribution using parallel computing framework;

---Directory "Codes for EC" contains all the Python codes that are used to conduct the numerical experiments listed in Section EC.4 of the paper entitled "A Birth and Death Chain Solution to a Spatial Queueing Problem".
